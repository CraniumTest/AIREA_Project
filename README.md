3. **Basic Market Analysis Capability:**
   - In its foundational form, AIREA offers basic market insights by leveraging a simplified machine learning approach. As the system evolves, these insights will become more refined, aiding in informed decision-making.

## Technical Components

- **Programming Language:**

  - Python has been employed as the primary language due to its robustness and excellent support for data science and AI-related libraries.

- **Core Libraries and Frameworks:**
  - **Flask:** Utilized as the framework to build a RESTful API for managing client requests and responses.
  - **OpenAI API:** Incorporated to facilitate natural language processing and interaction capabilities.
  - **pandas:** Used for handling and manipulation of data related to property listings and user preferences.
  - **scikit-learn:** Deployed for implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly for user preference analysis and recommendation systems.

## Application Architecture

- The application operates as a Flask-based web service with routes dedicated to handling different actions such as processing user inquiries and generating property recommendations.
- Natural language processing capabilities are powered by the OpenAI API, which allows the system to interpret and respond to users effectively.
- Property recommendation logic is implemented using TF-IDF vectorization combined with cosine similarity to match user profiles with property features.

## Setup Instructions
